"""Evidence grading and safety checks for OpenHealth.

This module encodes a deliberately simple confidence scale (C1-C5) inspired by
established evidence-grading systems (GRADE, Oxford CEBM, SORT, USPSTF) but
simplified for a personal, beginner-facing health system.

Design rules baked in here:
- A pattern derived purely from a user's own data defaults to at most C3
  ("hypothesis to test") until it survives an n-of-1 style repeated switch.
- Anything at C3 or below must be phrased as a question, not a statement.
- Red-flag findings short-circuit hypothesis generation and route the user to
  a clinician. The system never diagnoses or prescribes.

Nothing in this module is medical advice. It structures uncertainty so the rest
of the system can stay honest about what it does and does not know.
