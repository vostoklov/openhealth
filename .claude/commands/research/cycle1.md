# Cycle 1 — Broad Search (25-35% of time)

> Read this file before launching SCOUTs. Read `research/prompts.md` for agent prompts.

## Step 0: Mark research as in-progress

Before launching any agents, update the research queue:

```bash
python3 tools/update_research_queue.py start --topic "<RESEARCH_TITLE>"
```

This moves the queue entry from Ready → 🔄 In Progress. If no matching entry exists, this is a no-op.

## Step 0a: Previous Consensus Detection (MANDATORY)

Check `01_library/research/consensus_index.md` for existing research on this topic.

**How to match:** Search for topic keywords in the index entries (title, covers, reusable_for fields). A match means the SAME topic was previously researched — not merely related topics.

**If match found:**

1. Note the previous research path, creation date, and confidence score
2. Calculate time delta (months since creation)
3. **Ask user** (unless `--update` or `--fresh` flag provided):

```
Found existing consensus: "[title]"
  Path: [path to consensus_reference.md]
  Created: [date] ([N months ago])
  Confidence: [score]

Options:
  (a) UPDATE mode — full fresh research + temporal diff at the end
  (b) FRESH mode — independent research, no comparison
```

4. **If UPDATE mode selected:**
   - Set `UPDATE_MODE=true` in `_PROGRESS_LOG.md` header
   - Record `PREVIOUS_CONSENSUS_PATH=[full path]`
   - Record `TIME_DELTA=[N months]`
   - **DO NOT pass previous consensus to SCOUTs, CRITIC, or any Cycle 1-2 agents.** They must research independently to avoid anchoring bias.
   - The previous consensus is used ONLY in Cycle 3 by the TEMPORAL DIFF agent (see `cycle3.md` §4b-bis).

5. **If FRESH mode or no match:** proceed as normal. No further action.

**CLI flags:**
- `--update` — skip the question, force UPDATE mode (requires match in consensus_index)
- `--fresh` — skip the question, force FRESH mode (ignore any matches)
- No flag + no match → standard pipeline (no question asked)

## 1b. Coverage Check (MANDATORY before launching SCOUTs)

Before finalizing stream topics, verify COMPLETENESS:
- **Enumerate the full taxonomy** of the domain being researched (e.g., for food: all major food groups — vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, grains, dairy, meat, fish, eggs, oils, beverages, fermented, spices)
- **Check each category has a home** in at least one stream
- **Flag any "boring but important" items** that might be skipped because they're not controversial or novel (e.g., yogurt, turkey, buckwheat — not exciting but high-evidence)
- If any category is orphaned → either add to an existing stream or create an additional stream

This prevents the "novelty bias" where SCOUTs only cover what's interesting/controversial and miss staple foods.

## 1c. Claims Map (MANDATORY for supplements/interventions/single-agent research)

> **Rule added 2026-05-15** (origin: user feedback after 3 consecutive scoping misses in same session — H. pylori, Anti-TPO, sleep/nighttime calm). Memory: `feedback_dont_prune_claims_before_mapping.md`.

For research on a **specific supplement, drug, intervention, or single agent** (e.g., "should I take X?"), the food-taxonomy approach in §1b is insufficient. Build a **Claims Map** instead.

### The rule
**Map ALL universal claims FIRST. Filter to user N=1 SECOND.** Never pre-prune claims at scope step based on "probably not relevant to user" — that creates systematic blind spots. The SYNTHESIZER (v3.10 Universal-Landscape-before-Persona rule) filters at synthesis time; SCOUTS must map the full universe.

### Required claim categories (enumerate exhaustively at Step 1)

For each agent under study, list every claim across these 5 categories:

1. **Clinical (well-studied):** Every indication with ≥1 published RCT or meta-analysis. Include positive AND failed/null indications. Examples: lipid effect, glycemic effect, BP effect, thyroid effect, fertility, GDM prevention, depression, OCD, anxiety, panic, sleep, pregnancy outcomes, cancer-adjuvant, autoimmune.

2. **Wellness / influencer / "longevity" culture (often weak evidence):** Claims promoted by supplement marketing, podcasts, biohackers, even if evidence base is thin. Examples: brain fog, energy, mitochondrial, hair/skin, cognitive enhancement, anti-aging, stress/cortisol modulation, "calm/sleep cocktail" stacks, mood support, immune support, gut/microbiome, hormone balance. **DON'T skip these because they're marketing-driven** — user encounters them in the wild and needs informed assessment.

3. **Mechanism-driven hypotheses:** What does pharmacology suggest is possible, even without trials? Receptor binding, pathway modulation, cellular effects. Useful for steel-man and falsification.

4. **Drug / supplement interactions:** Every plausible interaction direction — CYP, transporters, receptor competition, additive effects, antagonisms. Include rare/severe (e.g., lithium-inositol PARADOX, MAOI-tyramine).

5. **Population-specific claims:** Pregnancy/lactation, pediatric, geriatric, specific genotype, specific comorbidity. Often have separate evidence base.

### Output format at Step 1 (paste into _PROGRESS_LOG.md)

A numbered exhaustive list (1-N), categorized. Then ASSIGN each claim to a stream (or note "not relevant to this scope" with reason). Never drop a claim silently.

### Red flag self-check

Before launching SCOUTs, ask:
- Does my scope feel **narrow and clean**? → Likely over-pruned. Re-broaden.
- Am I optimizing for the **user's apparent biomarkers** before knowing what claims exist? → Wrong order. Map universe first.
- Did I include **wellness/influencer claims** even if I expect them to be weak? → User will encounter them; explain them.
- Did I include **failed / null indications**? → Important context (e.g., scyllo-inositol failed Alzheimer's trials — must be discriminated from myo-inositol claims).
- Did I include the **inverse safety direction** (e.g., supplementation harm in specific populations)? → Bipolar/lithium-inositol paradox is the canonical example.

### When to compress the map

For very narrow research (e.g., "is dose X safe at duration Y for indication Z" — already-scoped follow-up), the Claims Map can be compressed to the relevant subset. But the DEFAULT for any new supplement/intervention question is the FULL map.

This prevents "narrow-scope-from-personalization bias" where SCOUTs only cover what looks user-relevant and miss claims user will encounter elsewhere.

## Step 0c. Pre-Research Data Adapter Detection (v4.3 — NEW)

> Runs AFTER scoping but BEFORE SCOUT launch. Produces `_patient_data_context.md` if applicable.
> Skipped silently if no adapter triggers fire — pipeline behaves identically to v4.2 in that case.

### Trigger detection

Two activation paths:

1. **CLI flag explicit:**
   - `/research <topic> --with-data <path>` → genome adapter
   - `/research <topic> --with-imaging <path>` → imaging adapter (v4.4, not yet active)

2. **Auto-detect from `context.md`:**
   - If `context.md` declares `patient_data.genome:` block AND topic matches genome keywords (MTHFR, APOE, FADS1, GSK3B, BDNF, pharmacogenomic, drug × gene, neuroprotection, cognitive longevity, lipid, vitamin D, folate, methylation, iron/ferritin, OR matches `rs\d+` pattern), genome adapter activates.
   - Same logic for imaging when v4.4 lands.

### Adapter invocation (genome — only ACTIVE adapter in v4.3)

If triggered, run:

```bash
python3 tools/research_adapters/genome_to_context.py \\
    --topic "<topic>" \\
    --source "<path from --with-data OR from context.md patient_data.genome.markdown_paths>" \\
    --out "<research_folder>/_patient_data_context.md"
```

**Source selection priority:**
1. `--with-data <path>` if provided
2. `context.md` → `patient_data.genome.markdown_paths` (directory with interpreted reports)
3. `context.md` → `patient_data.genome.vcf_path` (raw WGS)
4. Topic mentions specific data source → ask user one question

**Honest failure:**
- If genome adapter fails (no source, parse error, all DBs unreachable): write a stub `_patient_data_context.md` with the LIMITATIONS block explaining what's missing. Do NOT proceed silently.

### What SCOUTs do with `_patient_data_context.md`

When file exists, ORCHESTRATOR appends to each SCOUT prompt:

```
## Patient-Specific Data (v4.3 adapter output)

Read `_patient_data_context.md` in the research folder. It contains:
- Topic-filtered variants from user's source files
- ClinVar / SNPedia enrichment where available
- EXPLICIT LIMITATIONS — surface every limitation in your stream when relevant

Rules:
- When citing a variant, reference the source file + section it came from
- For LIMITATIONS-listed variants, DO NOT assume genotype — explicitly state "user data missing"
- When a variant is relevant to your stream BUT not in `_patient_data_context.md`, propose adding it to the user's genetics workup
```

If file does NOT exist (no trigger), SCOUTs operate as in v4.2.

### Sanity check before SCOUTs

After Step 0c, the orchestrator confirms:
- `_patient_data_context.md` exists (or was intentionally skipped)
- If genome adapter was triggered but produced empty output (0 topic-relevant variants) → flag in `_PROGRESS_LOG.md` as warning, continue

## 2a. SCOUTs (parallel)

1. Create `_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
2. **v4.3 — Load study card schema** based on domain:
   - Read `research/templates/study_card_<domain>.yaml` (e.g., `study_card_health.yaml`)
   - **Inline the full schema content** into each SCOUT prompt — they need it to produce cards
3. Launch 4-5 SCOUT agents (Task tool, subagent_type: general-purpose, run_in_background: true)
4. Each receives:
   - Base prompt from `research/prompts.md` section "## SCOUT"
   - **MANDATORY** unique reasoning style (A=Analytical, B=Contrarian, C=Mechanistic, D=Systems, E=Pragmatic) — style table in `research/prompts.md`
   - **v4.3:** inlined study card schema for the loaded domain
   - Stream topic and user context (if personalized)
5. **Output: 3 files per SCOUT (v4.3):**
   - `stream_[x]_[topic].md` (3-8K words narrative) — every numerical claim references `[card_x_NN]`
   - `[topic]_data.csv` (flat data for Cycle 3 viz)
   - **`stream_[x]_study_cards.md`** — ≥N cards per domain schema (health/company/science=10, macro/creative=8)
6. **After ALL SCOUTs → `ls` — verify all 3 files per stream exist. If `stream_*_study_cards.md` missing for any stream → re-prompt that SCOUT before proceeding to 2b. METHODOLOGIST cannot run without cards.**

## 2b. CRITIC + METHODOLOGIST (parallel)

Launch CRITIC (mandatory) and METHODOLOGIST (mandatory — ALL domains).

- CRITIC prompt: `research/prompts.md` section "## CRITIC"
- METHODOLOGIST prompt: `research/domains/[domain].md` section "## METHODOLOGIST / [domain]"

**Domain resolution:** determine domain from topic (health/macro/company/science). See `domains/*.md` for detection keywords. If ambiguous — ask user one question.

Both read ALL `stream_*.md` files. **METHODOLOGIST also reads (PRIMARY) all `stream_*_study_cards.md` files (v4.3).**

Output: `_critic_review.md` + `_methods_review.md` + **updated `stream_*_study_cards.md` with filled `methodologist_notes` / `reviewer_notes` fields (v4.3).**

## Reflection 1 (MANDATORY) — Hypothesis Generation

Write to `_PROGRESS_LOG.md`:

**A. Summary and analysis:**
- Summary of each stream
- **CRITIC highlights** (top-5 issues)
- **METHODOLOGIST highlights** (top-5, sources/studies to TRUST vs DISCOUNT)
- Surprises / unexpected findings

**B. Generate competing hypotheses (v3.6):**

Based on Cycle 1 findings, formulate **3-5 competing hypotheses**:

| # | Hypothesis | Mechanism (HOW/WHY) | Supporting streams | Contradicting | Testability |
|---|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|-------------|
| H1 | [statement] | [causal chain] | A, C | B | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| H2 | [statement] | [alternative mechanism] | B, D | — | HIGH |

For each hypothesis:
- **Falsifiability:** what would disprove this hypothesis?
- **Prediction:** what SPECIFICALLY must be true if H is correct?
- **Distinguishing test:** what evidence distinguishes H1 from H2?

Hypothesis generation techniques:
- **Assumption reversal:** "what if the accepted explanation is wrong?"
- **Cross-domain analogy:** mechanisms from adjacent fields
- **Scale shifting:** molecular → cellular → systemic → population level
- **Constraint removal:** "what if constraint X doesn't exist?"

**C. Prioritization for Cycle 2:**
- Gaps (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM)
- For each DEEP DIVER: which HYPOTHESIS it tests (not just "explore topic")
- Format: `DD-1: TEST H2 — [specific question] — PRIORITY: HIGH`
