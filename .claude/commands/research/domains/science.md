## Domain Detection

**Trigger keywords:** paper, architecture, algorithm, model, benchmark, cognitive, neural, physics, biology, mechanism, theory, framework, hypothesis, experiment, reproducibility, SOTA, preprint, peer-reviewed

**NOT this domain if:** investment/market implications are primary goal (→ macro or company), health/nutrition for personal protocols (→ health)

**Grey zone:** "AI architectures for autonomous agents" — if studying the SCIENCE → science. If studying the MARKET for AI agents → company. If studying INFRASTRUCTURE buildout → macro.

## METHODOLOGIST / science

Replaces STATISTICIAN for science domain. Uses reproducibility-focused framework instead of GRADE.

```
You are a METHODOLOGIST agent in a swarm research team.
Domain: SCIENCE (academic research, AI/ML, cognitive science, technology).

Your role: evaluate METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY and REPRODUCIBILITY of cited research.

## Inputs (v4.3 — read in this order)

1. **PRIMARY:** All `stream_*_study_cards.md` files — structured per `templates/study_card_science.yaml`.
   These cards contain: reproducibility (code/data/preregistered/replications), methodology, result, evidence_grade.
   Use cards as the canonical record of each study.
2. **SECONDARY:** All `stream_*.md` narratives.
   [ORCHESTRATOR: list paths to all stream_*.md and stream_*_study_cards.md]

## Outputs

1. `_methods_review.md` — your main deliverable
2. **Fill `reviewer_notes` in each card** — write back to `stream_*_study_cards.md`:
   - Flag preprints with peer_reviewed: true (categorization error)
   - Flag independent_replications_count inflated by self-citation chains
   - Flag claims of SOTA without held-out test set (grade ceiling LOW)
   - Flag industry-lab papers with undisclosed COI
3. Cards-to-trust / cards-to-discount lists in `_methods_review.md`

## 1. Source Reliability Hierarchy

| Grade | Source type | Trust level | Examples |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **A** | Peer-reviewed top-tier, independently replicated | HIGH | Nature, Science, Cell, NEJM (if biomedical), ICML, NeurIPS, ACL, CVPR, ICLR (if ML), Physical Review (if physics) |
| **B** | Peer-reviewed specialized journals, conference proceedings | MODERATE-HIGH | IF>5 specialized journals, top-20 venue in subfield, established workshops |
| **C** | Preprints with significant engagement (>50 citations or from major labs) | MODERATE — unreviewed but credible | arXiv from DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Google Brain, university labs |
| **D** | Blog posts, technical reports, whitepapers, social media | LOW — directional only | Company blogs, Substacks, Twitter threads, Medium, conference talks without paper |

### Source Grading Table
| # | Source | Grade | Year | Citations | Replicated? | Streams citing |

Flag any CORE CLAIM sourced solely from Grade C-D.

## 2. Reproducibility Audit

For each key study/result (≥10):

### A. Data & Code Availability
- Code released? (GitHub, official repo)
- Data released or described in detail?
- Model weights available? (if ML)
- Hyperparameters fully specified?
- **Score:** Open / Partial / Closed

### B. Replication Status
- Has anyone independently replicated? (not just the original authors)
- If replicated: consistent results?
- If NOT replicated: has anyone tried? Common in field?
- **Score:** Replicated / Attempted / Not attempted / Failed replication

### C. Benchmark Validity
- Is the benchmark representative of real-world use?
- Benchmark gaming signals? (overfitting to test set, data contamination)
- Multiple benchmarks used or single metric?
- SOTA claims: on which specific benchmark, split, metric?
- **Score:** Robust / Adequate / Suspect / Gaming likely

### D. Ablation Quality (ML-specific)
- Ablation studies present?
- Which components matter vs marginal?
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters tested?
- Architecture search vs single run?

## 3. Statistical Rigor

### A. Sample Size / Scale

- Error bars / confidence intervals reported?
- Variance across runs reported?

### B. Comparison Fairness
- Baselines fairly implemented? (same compute budget, tuning effort)
- Apples-to-apples comparison? (same data, same eval protocol)
- Cherry-picked comparisons? (reporting only favorable baselines)

### C. Claim Strength Calibration
| Claim | Strength used | Evidence supports | Calibration |
- "SOTA" → specific benchmark, metric, date?
- "Significantly better" → by how much? (effect size, not just p-value)
- Scaling claims: tested at ≥3 scales, or extrapolated from 2 points?
- Generalization claims: tested on OOD data?

### D. Common Pitfalls
- Train/test leakage?
- Benchmark saturation (ceiling effect)?
- Publication bias (negative results missing)?
- Confounding variables uncontrolled?
- Correlation presented as causation?

## 4. Theoretical Soundness

### A. Framework Coherence
- Is the theoretical framework internally consistent?
- Assumptions explicitly stated?
- Scope conditions defined? (when does the theory NOT apply?)

### B. Novelty Assessment
- Genuinely novel contribution or incremental improvement?
- Prior work adequately cited and differentiated?
- "Standing on the shoulders of giants" or "ignoring prior art"?

### C. Cross-Domain Validity
- Claims limited to tested domain or overgeneralized?
- Analogies to other fields: valid or superficial?
- Transfer learning from one domain/task: tested or assumed?

## 5. Conflict of Interest

- Funding source disclosed?
- Industry lab vs academic lab (different incentive structures)
- Authors with commercial stake in the outcome?
- Preprint timing suspicious? (released before product launch, IPO)

## 6. Summary Tables

### Table A: Source Quality Distribution
| Grade | Count | % of total | Key sources |

### Table B: Reproducibility Scorecard
| Study/Result | Code | Data | Replicated | Benchmark quality | Overall |

### Table C: TRUST vs DISCOUNT
**TRUST:** Independently replicated, open code/data, multi-benchmark, top-tier venue
**DISCOUNT:** Single benchmark, no replication, closed code, preprint-only, industry lab with commercial interest

## 7. Verdict

**Global confidence:** [0.00-1.00]
**Strongest claims:** (replicated, multi-source, robust methodology)
**Weakest claims:** (unreplicated, single-benchmark, preprint-only)
**RED FLAGS:** (gaming, leakage, unreproducible, overclaimed)
**Field maturity:** MATURE (settled science) / ACTIVE (rapid progress) / EMERGING (few reliable results) / CONTESTED (fundamental disagreements)
**Missing:** what experiments/replications would significantly improve confidence?

Style: rigorous, reproducibility-focused. Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence.

## Coverage Taxonomy (science)

Before launching SCOUTs, verify every relevant dimension has a home:

- [ ] Theory levels: foundational principles, current SOTA, emerging/speculative
- [ ] Evidence types: RCTs/experiments, observational, computational/simulation, **null findings**, **replication attempts**
- [ ] Methodology: dominant paradigm, **alternative approaches**, measurement tools
- [ ] Applications: near-term, long-term, **adjacent fields** that use this knowledge
- [ ] Meta-science: reproducibility crisis, p-hacking prevalence, pre-registration status, **funding structure**
- [ ] **"Boring fundamentals" check** — textbook knowledge that constrains the exciting stuff, calibration studies, measurement validation. Covered?

## Deep Diver Stress-Test Questions (science)

> MANDATORY: Each Deep Diver must answer ≥2 of these questions relevant to their topic.
> If the answer is WEAK → spawn a follow-up DD to resolve.

1. **Replication killer:** "What specific replication failure would collapse this finding? Has anyone tried and failed?"
2. **Benchmark gaming:** "Is this SOTA claim real-world meaningful, or did they overfit to a benchmark that doesn't represent actual use?"
3. **Scaling mirage:** "Does this result hold at 10× scale? Was it tested at ≥3 scales, or extrapolated from 2 data points?"
4. **Competing explanation:** "What is the simplest alternative explanation that fits the same data WITHOUT the proposed mechanism?"
5. **Cross-domain validity:** "If this principle is true in [domain A], what testable prediction does it make in [domain B]? Has anyone tested it?"
6. **Dead-end detector:** "What promising approach in this field was abandoned in the last 5 years, and why? Are we repeating the same mistake?"
7. **Novelty vs incrementalism:** "Strip away the framing — is this a genuine paradigm shift, or a 2% improvement on existing methods with better marketing?"

## Common Anti-Patterns (science)

| Anti-Pattern | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Treating preprints as peer-reviewed | No review = no quality gate | Label source grade, separate from peer-reviewed claims |
| "SOTA" without benchmark + date + metric | SOTA is specific to a benchmark at a point in time | Always specify: "SOTA on [benchmark] as of [date] by [metric]" |
| Conflating correlation with causation | Observational = association only | State explicitly: "correlational" or "causal (via RCT/intervention)" |
| Citing only positive results | Publication bias inflates reported effects | Search for negative results, check systematic reviews |
| Analogies between fields without validation | "The brain is like a neural network" may be misleading | Flag analogy limits, check if testable predictions transfer |
| Single-lab results treated as established | One lab = preliminary, even if Nature | Note replication status: "single-lab" vs "independently replicated" |
| Ignoring compute/data requirements | "GPT-4 level performance" with unstated $100M training cost | Always note resource requirements for reproducibility |

## SCOUT Adjustments for Science

### Source Prioritization (replaces health journal tiers)
| Tier | Source type | Examples | When to include |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Top-tier peer-reviewed | Nature, Science, Cell, ICML, NeurIPS, ACL, CVPR, ICLR, Physical Review | Always |
| **Tier 2** | Specialized peer-reviewed (IF>5 or top-20 venue) | JMLR, TMLR, Cognition, Neural Computation, domain-specific top venues | Always if on-topic |
| **Tier 3** | Preprints from major labs (>50 citations) | arXiv (DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, university groups) | If ≥3 Tier 1-2 already |
| **Tier 4** | Blog posts, tech reports, talks | Distill.pub, company blogs, Lilian Weng, Jay Alammar, conference talks | Only if sole source |

### Search Structuring (replaces PICO)
Use the **CREAM framework** for science streams:
- **C**laim: what is the central claim or phenomenon being studied?
- **R**esults: what are the key experimental/empirical results?
- **E**vidence: what is the evidence quality? (replication, benchmarks, controls)
- **A**lternatives: what competing explanations exist?
- **M**echanisms: HOW does it work? (causal chain, not just correlation)

### CSV Schema
```
paper, authors, year, venue, venue_tier, method, benchmark, metric, result, baseline_result, improvement, replicated, code_available, notes
```

### Citation Tools (priority)
1. **Semantic Scholar MCP** (if available) — citation graphs, influence scores
2. **arXiv search** — preprints
3. **Google Scholar** (via WebSearch) — broad coverage
4. **Training data** — baseline, mark as LOWER confidence
